A tool for classifying directed arcs in complex networks into four hierarchical types:

- **BOND** — Strong connections embedded within tight communities; removing them does not alter community structure.
- **Silk** — Pendant arcs where one endpoint has degree 1; removal isolates that node.
- **Local Bridge** — Cross-cluster connections linking nearby communities.
- **Global Bridge** — Long-range connections linking distant communities; removal may disconnect the network.

HATA extends the [HETA](https://github.com/canslab1/HETA) framework (designed for undirected graphs) to **directed networks** by replacing the "common friends" concept with directional ego networks (outgoing/incoming).

## Overview

Many real-world networks are inherently directed — information flows, citation graphs, food webs, and online social interactions all have asymmetric relationships. While HETA can classify edges in undirected networks, directed arcs require a fundamentally different approach to neighborhood overlap computation.

HATA addresses this by constructing separate outgoing and incoming ego networks for each arc endpoint, enabling the classification of directed arcs into the same four hierarchical types. This extension preserves the parameter-free, topology-driven philosophy of HETA while correctly handling the asymmetry of directed connections.

## Features

- **Parameter-free** — Classification is driven entirely by network topology; no community labels, edge weights, or manual thresholds required.
- **Directed network support** — Handles directed arcs using separate outgoing/incoming ego networks.
- **Multi-scale analysis** — Ego networks expand layer by layer, capturing both local and global structural information.
- **Statistically adaptive thresholds** — R1 threshold derived from degree-preserving random directed null models.
- **Multi-format input** — Supports Pajek (.net), GML, GraphML, edge list, and adjacency list formats.
- **Dual interface** — Both a PySide6 GUI and a full-featured CLI.
- **Parallel processing** — Random network generation can use multiple CPU cores.
- **Rich output** — Excel workbooks, CSV arc classification tables (Gephi/Cytoscape compatible), and multiple plot types.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canslab1/HATA.git
cd HATA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |

## Usage

### GUI Mode

```bash
python run_hata.py
```

- **Arc Analysis** — Load a single directed network, configure parameters, view classification results and various plots.
- **Suite Experiment** — Batch-analyze a predefined set of networks and compare their fingerprints.

### CLI Mode

```bash
# Analyze a single directed network
python run_hata.py analyze -i nets/leader.net

# With options
python run_hata.py analyze -i nets/leader.net -t 100 -p    # 100 random networks, parallel mode
python run_hata.py analyze -i nets/leader.net -q 2          # Quick mode (limit to 2 layers)
python run_hata.py analyze -i nets/leader.net --export-csv   # Export arc classification CSV

# Run suite experiment
python run_hata.py suite --name DEMO --run --dir nets/
```

## Algorithm Overview

```
Read directed network → Split into weakly connected components
  → Build outgoing/incoming multi-layer ego networks
  → Compute neighborhood overlap for each arc at each layer
  → Generate degree-preserving random directed networks (null model)
  → Derive R1 threshold from null model
  → Phase 1: Identify SILK (degree-1 endpoints)
  → Phase 2: Classify BOND vs LOCAL_BRIDGE (R1 + R2 thresholds, layer-by-layer refinement)
  → Phase 3: Remaining unclassified arcs → GLOBAL_BRIDGE
  → Phase 4: Node information entropy & structural importance
  → Phase 5: Network fingerprint output
